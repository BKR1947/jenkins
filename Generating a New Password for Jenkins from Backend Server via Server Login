To generate a new password for Jenkins from a backend server by logging into the Jenkins server, you can follow these steps:

1. **Login to Jenkins Server**: SSH into the Jenkins server using the appropriate credentials. This will give you command-line access to the server.

2. **Navigate to Jenkins Directory**: Depending on your Jenkins installation, navigate to the directory where Jenkins is installed. Typically,
it might be something like `/var/lib/jenkins` or `/opt/jenkins`.

3. **Locate Jenkins Configuration Files**: Jenkins stores its configuration in XML files. The primary configuration file is `config.xml`,
which is located in the Jenkins home directory.

4. **Generate New Password**: You can use a command-line tool like `openssl` or any other method to generate a new password hash.
Jenkins usually stores passwords in the form of a hash. For example, to generate an MD5 hash of a password "newpassword123", 
you can use the following command:

   ```
   echo -n "newpassword123" | md5sum
   ```

   This will give you an MD5 hash that you can use as the new password hash.

5. **Update Jenkins Configuration**: Open the `config.xml` file using a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `gedit`) and 
locate the section where Jenkins user information is stored. This might look something like:

   ```
   <useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
   <authorizationStrategy class="hudson.security.AuthorizationStrategy$Unsecured"/>
   <securityRealm class="hudson.security.SecurityRealm$None"/>
   ...
   ```

   Depending on your Jenkins security configuration, you might have different sections. Find the relevant user entry, 
which could be the `<user>` tag, and replace the existing password hash with the newly generated hash.

6. **Save and Restart Jenkins**: After updating the password hash in the `config.xml` file, save the changes and then 
restart Jenkins for the changes to take effect. You can usually restart Jenkins using a command like:

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart jenkins
   ```

7. **Test the New Password**: Once Jenkins has restarted, try logging into the Jenkins web interface using the new password you generated. 
Make sure that the password works as expected.

Please note that manipulating Jenkins configuration files directly can be risky and can lead to unexpected issues if not done correctly. 
It's recommended to have a backup of your Jenkins configuration before making changes.
any changes and to thoroughly test the new password to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
